# Installation Detail
1. All of us is using Linux, therefore I will point directly to [this installation link](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux). 
In the official docs, there are 2 choices, but i recommended [installing manually](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux#install-flutter-manually) (`snapd` option is not recommended for Arch Linux, it's not stable yet).

    After installed successfully, you will need to add `flutter` to your `PATH` and activate it to use `flutter` & `dart` commands. Linux uses the Bash shell by default, so edit `$HOME/.bashrc`. If you are using a different shell (zsh, tmux, etc...), the file path and filename will be different on your machine.
    for e.g. in my case:
    ```bash 
    export PATH="$PATH:/home/thaodt/projects/flutter/bin"
    ```

2. Run `flutter doctor` (a **super useful** command!! DONT MISS IT!)
    ```bash
    $ flutter doctor -v
    ```
- This command checks your environment and displays a report to the terminal window. The Dart SDK is bundled with Flutter; it is not necessary to install Dart separately. 
- Please notice the RED check marks, you may need to install or further tasks to perform (shown in **bold** text).

- You may need to install Android Studio to use Android Emulator.
Just go to our https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/android-studio, clone & make build it (`makepkg -si`).

- Next install [`cargo-ndk`](https://github.com/bbqsrc/cargo-ndk#installing), add rust target cross compilation.

- Install NDK side-by-side with Android Studio, follow [this guide](http://cjycode.com/flutter_rust_bridge/template/setup_android.html#android_ndk).

- Finally for Android setup, you will need to [put its path](http://cjycode.com/flutter_rust_bridge/template/setup_android.html#android_ndk-gradle-property) in one of the `gradle.properties`, e.g.:
```
echo "ANDROID_NDK=(path to NDK)" >> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
```
You may want to update that path in `LitheumMobileWallet/android/gradle.properties`, im putting my path (`ANDROID_NDK`) in that file.

- Add your NDK path to your `PATH` and activate it: `export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/home/thaodt/Android/Sdk/ndk` (replace by your local path).

- Rerun `flutter doctor -v` again to see all green checks.

- [Optional] Install codegen & `just` cmd helper (a modern command runner alternative to `Make`), following [this guide](http://cjycode.com/flutter_rust_bridge/template/generate_install.html).

Please see my sample output for `flutter doctor -v` once all green checks:

## Project Structure
This project should be available if you create a new Flutter project by command `flutter init`, but i made use of the template from author.
Just a bit different from the original flutter project initialization, you will see `native` dir. Its our Rust code, `api.rs` is pub ffi fns which we want to export for Dart code.

`flutter_rust_brigde` dependency package helped us generated `bridge_generated.rs` & `LitheumMobileWallet/lib/bridge_generated.dart`.

So all `lib` files is DART code & `native` is our RUST code. 

As long as we don't touch GUI code on android/ios app, it's fine to use vscode or any editors/IDEs.

Another good news, Package's author is very active. 
He almost replied/supported within 10 mins, so if any queries, we can ping/create issue in his github repository.
